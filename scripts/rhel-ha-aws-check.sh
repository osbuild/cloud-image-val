# rhel-ha-aws-check.sh - Sanity check script for RHEL HA running on AWS.

# Author: Brandon Perkins <bperkins@redhat.com>

# This script is designed to be run on a single instance and does not perform
# any multi-node tests.  This script validates the ability to install,
# configure, and run the very basics of a pacemaker cluster, the AWS fence
# agent, and the AWS resource agents.
